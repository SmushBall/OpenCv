OpenCV is a library written in C++ for Computer Vision.
There are bindings available in java and python for OpenCV.

OpenCV has a lot of powerful functions which makes it easier to process images, detect shapes, and analyse objects in an Image.

OpenCV is one of the most popular library for Computer Vision and Image Processing.

My Goal is to understand and learn basics features in OpenCV and use it explore the possibilities with Computer Vision.
